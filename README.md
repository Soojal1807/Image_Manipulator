Hello

I have made this image manipulator as i was studing python libraries like tkinter and numpy.
Pointers about my what and why i used specific libraries project:

TKINTER library :
1. Gui was given by using tkinter , gui parts like sliders anf the button to load image were used.
   
NUMPY library:
2. numpy is used to manipulate image data by converting the image into numpy array by using np.array() function. I think this could have been done tkinter alone but i decided to use numpy.

PILLOW library :   
3. Pillow is a imaging library which is used after manipulation is done data is converted backto  PIL image.
